"A warrior whom God gave more than common gifts and then put under a more than common burden."
\- Three Hearts and Three Lions, Poul Anderson

Paladins have sworn a vow to the powers of the light, to the forces of law and good, or to the gods themselves.  This vow is to protect the innocent, heal the sick, and seek out those who would bring evil to this world and vanquish them.  In exchange for this burden, a paladin is granted powers to aid them in their quests.  As long as a paladin remains true to their cause and the powers of good, they will retain these powers; however, should a paladin fall to the temptations of evil, they lose the blessings they have been given and must atone in order to receive them again.

## Secondary Skill

### Grace (CHA)

When using the spell-like powers of the paladin heroic abilities, roll Grace to determine if the power is successfully cast.  On a dragon roll, you may either double the damage or range of the power, or the power does not cost any WP.

At character creation, a Paladin may choose this skill and gets their CHA base chance doubled as usual for starting skills.  An existing character may become a Paladin by swearing their vow to the powers of good and taking one of the three Paladin heroic abilities.  The new Paladin then gets their CHA base chance as the skill level in Grace.

Paladins can take the other Paladin heroic abilities when they select a new heroic ability as long as they meet the other requirements - no additional vows needed.

## Heroic Abilities

### Crusader (Paladin)
- **Requirement**: Any STR-based melee weapon skill 12
- **Willpower Points**: 2 or 3

As long as you remain true to your vow to the powers of good, you may use the following spell-like abilities.  Activating each ability requires a successful Grace roll.

**Mark of the Crusade**: Spend an action and 2 WP to call down a beam of light from the heavens, dealing 1d8 points of damage to a target, plus an additional 1d8 damage to undead and demons.  For as long as the beam remains, attacks against the target gain a boon. On each of the target's turns, the target can make a Willpower roll (not an action) to dispel the beam and end the effect.

**Radiant Weapon**: Spend an action and 3 WP to imbue your weapon with radiant energy, causing it to burst into bright white fire.  For one stretch, this weapon counts as magical and deals 1d6 additional damage on hit, plus an additional 1d6 damage to undead and demons.

### Hospitaler (Paladin)
- **Requirement**: Healing 12
- **Willpower Points**: 2 or 3

As long as you remain true to your vow to the powers of good, you may use the following spell-like abilities.  Activating each ability requires a successful Grace roll.

**Consecrate Ground**: Spend an action and 2 WP to smash your weapon (or fist) into the ground, shooting out radiant light in a 4-meter radius.  Living creatures within the area are healed for 1d8 hit points (including yourself), while demons and undead suffer 1d8 damage.  This effect can be dodged but not parried.

**Inspire**: Spend an action and 3 WP to emit a soft glow, inspiring your allies within 10 meters of you.  You and affected allies gain a boon on all WIL rolls to resist fear.  This effect lasts for a stretch or until you fail to resist fear.

### Protector (Paladin)
- **Requirement**: Any STR-based melee weapon skill 12
- **Willpower Points**: 2 or 3

As long as you remain true to your vow to the powers of good, you may use the following spell-like abilities.  Activating each ability requires a successful Grace roll.

**Radiant Shield**: When parrying with your shield, spend 2 WP (not an action) to imbue your shield with bright white light. On a successful parry with the shield, you also deal 1d10 damage to the attacker and your shield ignores all damage (cannot be broken).

**Resplendent Barrier**: Spend an action and 3 WP to create a 6-meter radius dome of shimmering light (centered on you) that protects those inside from ranged attacks and spells.  All ranged attacks and spells (that are capable of being parried) that pass through the barrier are subject to a parry (using your Grace skill) before they reach their target.  The barrier has a durability of 21 and the effect is immediately broken if this durability is exceeded on a successful parry.  The barrier lasts for as long as you continue using actions to keep it up on your turn (no further WP expenditure needed).  You may move, which causes the barrier to move with you.
